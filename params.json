Also added signal handling to clear the LED display\r\nbefore exit when lcdstats process is interrupted.\r\n\r\nAdditional utilities are added to privide more functionality on LED backlight\r\ncontrol (see hardware modification description below) and message display.\r\n\r\nProvided utilities can be used in shell scripting for Raspberry PI projects\r\nrequiring low cost message indication.\r\n\r\nDownload and install instructions are on http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/\r\n\r\n# Building\r\n\r\nClone repository and build\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:acidum/PCD8544-utils.git\r\n$ cd ./PCD8544-utils\r\n$ make all\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create binaries in ./bin directory.\r\n\r\nYou may want to edit src/pin_setup.h file to customize PIN numbers and LCD Contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nCompiled programs require root priveleges to set Raspberry PI GPIO ports.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Continuously print system statistics\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdstats \r\n\r\n# Show Raspberry PI Logo\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdlogo  \r\n\r\n# Display text message\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdprint 'Hello world!'\r\n\r\n# Turn LED backlight ON, OFF and blinking\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdlights on\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdlights off\r\n$ sudo bin/lcdlights blink\r\n```\r\n\r\nOwner for those files can be changed to root and SUID attributes applied to\r\nbe able to run without sudo.\r\n\r\n# Hardware Hack to control Backlight LED\r\nMultiple vendors do supply Raspberry Pi PCD8544 Shield having backlight\r\nconnected to +3.3V pin 1 through a resistor so that backlight is always ON if\r\nRaspberry Pi is connected to power source. This might reduce the running time\r\nif you have autonomous solution running on a battery.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nPlease note, that any modification you do is on your own risk, you also may\r\nlose the a warranty for the modified components. Wrong assembly can also\r\ndestroy Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nSteps to enable backlight control on a stock PCD8544 Rasberry Pi shield are\r\nprovided below.\r\n\r\n## Parts list\r\n* Raspberry Pi PCD8544 Shield\r\n* Soldering iron\r\n* Small piece of wire\r\n\r\n## Steps\r\n* Prepare PCB: create small groves on the edge of PCB to accommodate the wire.\r\nthis could be done using dremmerl tool or a smal rasp (see pictures below).\r\n* Heat your soldering iron.\r\n* With soldering iron melt both left and right joints of the resistor (see pictures below).\r\n* When resistor is free, move it to the left so that it stays connected on one end.\r\n* Solder a wire to the other side of resistor.\r\n* Fit the wire into the groves\r\n* Solder the wire to PIN21 (GPIO9)\r\n\r\n## Pictures\r\n![Raspberry Pi with modified LCD shield](img/raspberry-lcd.png)\r\n![Resistor Hack](img/resistor-hack.png)\r\n![Wire behind the shield](img/shield-back.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
